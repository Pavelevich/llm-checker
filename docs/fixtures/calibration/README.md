# Calibration Docs Fixtures

This folder contains deterministic examples used in documentation and tests.

- `sample-suite.jsonl`:
  - Minimal prompt suite for first-time calibration runs.
  - Includes `coding` and `general` tasks.
- `sample-generated-policy.yaml`:
  - Example routing policy artifact generated from calibration output.
  - Compatible with `recommend --calibrated` and `ai-run --calibrated`.

Use these fixtures to run the calibration quick start without creating files from scratch.
